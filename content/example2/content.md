After creating a new project in Dymodia, the first step is to create a new system architecture model to represent the system.

	<i>Architecture for the Fuel System</i>
</p>

Adding components is straightforward, and ports can be added and positioned in a simple, flexible manner. Components can also be copied and pasted as required. Joining ports is done by simply clicking and dragging the connections onto other ports.
